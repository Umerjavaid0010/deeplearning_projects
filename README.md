# deeplearning_projects
This is my first project focused on learning deep learning concepts, showcasing the power of YOLOv11 for accurate and efficient object detection by running inference on images and videos.
I learned how to train the YOLOv11 model using your custom dataset in Google Colab. From dataset labeling to importing and how to use roboflow for dataset.
On 2nd assingment , I have converted real textual data of imdb dataset into embedding and then train the model.
